# API Instrumentation Report

## Overview
This document describes the instrumentation added to the Escape Room application's API endpoints and shows the results of running tests with this instrumentation enabled.

## Instrumentation Implementation

### What Was Instrumented
All CRUD API endpoints have been instrumented with:
- **Request logging**: Timestamp and endpoint identification
- **Request body logging**: Parameters received (sanitized for sensitive data)
- **Performance timing**: Execution duration in milliseconds
- **Success/Error logging**: Outcome and details
- **Resource counting**: Number of records retrieved/created

### Instrumented Endpoints

#### 1. Game Results API (`/api/game-results`)
- **GET** - List game results
  - Logs: Request timestamp, number of results retrieved, execution time
- **POST** - Save game result
  - Logs: Request timestamp, player name, status, times, created ID, execution time

#### 2. Items API (`/api/items`)
- **GET** - List items
  - Logs: Request timestamp, number of items retrieved, execution time
- **POST** - Create item
  - Logs: Request timestamp, item name/description, created ID, execution time

#### 3. Code Outputs API (`/api/code-outputs`)
- **GET** - List code outputs
  - Logs: Request timestamp, number of outputs retrieved, execution time
- **POST** - Save code output
  - Logs: Request timestamp, title, language, content length, created ID, execution time

### Log Format
All instrumentation logs follow this format:
```
[INSTRUMENTATION] <METHOD> <ENDPOINT> - <MESSAGE>
```

Examples:
```
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Request received at 2025-10-20T07:44:25.094Z
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Body: { playerName: 'Playwright E2E Test', status: 'win', ... }
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Success: Created ID 30 in 10ms
```

## Test Results

### Test Execution Summary
Date: October 20, 2025
Test Suite: Playwright E2E Tests
Container: Docker (ass2:latest)
Database: SQLite (persisted in ./data/database.sqlite)

### API Traffic Analysis

**Request Distribution:**
```
POST /api/game-results:    12 requests
GET  /api/game-results:     4 requests
POST /api/code-outputs:     3 requests
POST /api/items:            2 requests
GET  /api/items:            2 requests
───────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                     23 requests
```

### Performance Metrics

#### Game Results API
- **POST requests**: 9-20ms average
  - Fastest: 9ms
  - Slowest: 20ms
  - Records created: IDs 28-32 (5 new records)
  
- **GET requests**: 4-5ms average
  - Retrieval speed: Very fast (< 10ms)
  - Records returned: 27-30 results per request

#### Items API
- **POST request**: Created successfully
  - Example: "E2E Test Item" with description
  
- **GET request**: 161ms (first request, includes DB initialization)
  - Retrieved 3 items

#### Code Outputs API
- **POST requests**: 15ms average
  - Created IDs: 4+
  - Content logged with length tracking

### Sample Instrumentation Output

```
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Request received at 2025-10-20T07:44:25.094Z
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Body: {
  playerName: 'Playwright E2E Test',
  status: 'win',
  completionTime: 120,
  totalTime: 180
}
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Success: Created ID 30 in 10ms
[INSTRUMENTATION] GET /api/game-results - Request received at 2025-10-20T07:44:25.119Z
[INSTRUMENTATION] GET /api/game-results - Success: Retrieved 30 results in 4ms
```

### Error Handling
The instrumentation also logs validation errors:
```
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/items - Validation failed: name required
[INSTRUMENTATION] POST /api/game-results - Validation failed: missing required fields
```

## Observations

### Performance
1. **Fast DB operations**: Most CRUD operations complete in < 20ms
2. **Efficient queries**: GET operations are very quick (< 10ms typically)
3. **First request overhead**: Initial requests show higher latency (~160ms) due to DB initialization

### Reliability
1. **All tests passed**: No 500 errors observed during test run
2. **Data persistence**: Records successfully saved to SQLite database
3. **Validation working**: Required field checks functioning correctly

### Coverage
1. **All CRUD operations tested**:
   - Create (POST) ✅
   - Read (GET) ✅
   - Update (PUT) - Available but not tested in this run
   - Delete (DELETE) - Available but not tested in this run

## How to View Instrumentation Logs

### Real-time monitoring:
```bash
sudo docker logs -f nextjs-app 2>&1 | grep "INSTRUMENTATION"
```

### Filter by endpoint:
```bash
sudo docker logs nextjs-app 2>&1 | grep "INSTRUMENTATION" | grep "/api/game-results"
```

### Count requests:
```bash
sudo docker logs nextjs-app 2>&1 | grep "INSTRUMENTATION" | grep -E "(POST|GET)" | awk '{print $2, $3}' | sort | uniq -c
```

### View timing data:
```bash
sudo docker logs nextjs-app 2>&1 | grep "Success:" | grep -oP '\d+ms'
```

## Benefits of This Instrumentation

1. **Debugging**: Quickly identify slow requests or errors
2. **Performance monitoring**: Track response times and optimize bottlenecks
3. **Usage analytics**: Understand which endpoints are most frequently used
4. **Audit trail**: See what data was created/modified and when
5. **Testing verification**: Confirm that tests are exercising the correct endpoints

## Future Enhancements

1. **Structured logging**: Use JSON format for easier parsing
2. **Log aggregation**: Send logs to external service (e.g., CloudWatch, Datadog)
3. **Metrics collection**: Track request counts, error rates, percentiles
4. **Alerting**: Notify on errors or performance degradation
5. **Request IDs**: Add correlation IDs to track requests across services
6. **User tracking**: Log authenticated user information (when auth is added)

## Conclusion

The instrumentation successfully provides visibility into:
- API request flow and timing
- Data being processed
- Performance characteristics
- Error conditions

All tests completed successfully with the instrumentation in place, demonstrating that the logging does not negatively impact application functionality.
